<p align="justify">
In the digital era, sharing knowledge and connecting communities has become easier than ever, thanks to the rapid development of social networking platforms. Especially for the Information Technology (IT) community, the need to seek information, learn, and exchange experiences is essential. With the desire to create a dedicated space that connects IT enthusiasts and supports learning and research, the Code4Life social network was born.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Code4Life is not only a gathering place for programmers and software engineers but also a platform where members can participate in study groups and share information across various fields. Technologically, the project "Building the Code4Life Social Network" utilizes two key technologies: ReactJS and Spring Boot. Specifically, ReactJS plays a central role in developing the user interface, providing a flexible and interactive experience. Meanwhile, Spring Boot handles server-side processing, ensuring high performance and security for the system.

## Key Features
- User Authentication: Supports email and social media authentication.

- Personal Profiles: Users can manage their information, skills, and personal projects.

- Q&A Forum: A space to post questions and comment on technology-related discussions.

- Study & Collaboration Groups: Allows users to create and join study groups for effective teamwork.

- Real-time Notifications & Interactions: Ensures quick feedback and communication among members.

- User Authentication: Registration & Login

- Content Sharing: Post and share articles

- Social Connection: Add and connect with friends

- Study Groups: Create and manage learning groups

### System Design
- Non-Functional Requirements: Security (JWT, SQL Injection prevention).

### Frontend
- Built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to provide an intuitive and optimized user experience.

<p align="justify">
React.js is an open-source library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook), primarily used to create user interfaces by combining components. One of React's standout advantages is its flexibility, allowing developers to use it at any scaleâ€”from integrating a small part into a webpage to building an entire web application based on React.
</p>

### Backend
- Developed using **Spring Boot**, handling business logic and API services.

<p align="justify">
Spring Boot is a Java framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of web applications and services. By providing auto-configuration for various libraries and tools, Spring Boot enables developers to quickly build, deploy, and manage applications on the Spring platform without requiring extensive manual configuration.
</p>

### Database
- **MongoDB** is used to store and manage data efficiently.

<p align="justify">
MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database management system developed based on a non-relational model. This technology offers a more flexible approach to storing and querying data compared to traditional relational databases. It stores information in the form of documents, optimizing data management and retrieval for applications that require flexibility and scalability.
</p>

### Deployment
- Hosting: Deployed using Vercel for wide-scale user access.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm (for frontend)
- Java & Gradle (for backend)
- MongoDB (for database)
